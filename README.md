# Course-Project
The purpose of project was to facilitate the search of wine and to help user feel confident about their wine choices. I received the information through a request to the server and saved the data in Core Data. The user had 2 ways to search for wine in the app. The first by name, the second by text in the photo taken by the user. The text in the photo was processed using ML KIt.
